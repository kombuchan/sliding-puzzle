The goal node is denoted by node_goal and the source node is denoted by node_start

We maintain two lists: OPEN and CLOSE:

OPEN consists on nodes that have been visited but not expanded (meaning that sucessors have not been
explored yet). This is the list of pending tasks.\

CLOSE consists on nodes that have been visited and expanded (sucessors have been explored already and
included in the open list, if this was the case).

Put node_start in the OPEN list with f(node_start) = h(node_start) (initialization)
while the OPEN list is not empty {
    Take from the open list the node node_current with the lowest
        f(node_current) = g(node_current) + h(node_current)
    if node_current is node_goal we have found the solution; break
    Generate each state node_successor that come after node_current
    for each node_successor of node_current {
        Set successor_current_cost = g(node_current) + w(node_current, node_successor)
        if node_successor is in the OPEN list {
            if g(node_successor) ≤ successor_current_cost continue (to line 33)
        }
        else if node_successor is in the CLOSED list {
            if g(node_successor) ≤ successor_current_cost continue (to line 33)
            Move node_successor from the CLOSED list to the OPEN list
        }
        else{
            Add node_successor to the OPEN list
            Set h(node_successor) to be the heuristic distance to node_goal
        }
        Set g(node_successor) = successor_current_cost
        Set the parent of node_successor to node_current
    }
        Add node_current to the CLOSED list
}

 if(node_current != node_goal) exit with error (the OPEN list is empty)
